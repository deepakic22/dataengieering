# AWS Data Science & Engineering — 48-Week Program (1 hour/day)

This repo contains a complete, concept-first roadmap that builds depth in **Python → Spark → Lakehouse (Iceberg) → AWS (Glue/Athena/LF/Redshift) → Streaming (Kinesis/MSK) → CDC → Orchestration (SFN/MWAA) → Data Quality → Security/Observability/Cost → ML (SageMaker) → GenAI (Bedrock)**.

## How to use your 1-hour session
- **0–15 min:** Read the day’s topic (in each `week-XX` folder) and jot 5 bullet notes.
- **15–40 min:** Do the smallest possible lab/snippet for that day’s topic.
- **40–60 min:** Update the week README with what/why + ops/cost/security notes.

## Structure
- `weeks/week-XX - <Theme>/README.md` — day-by-day tasks (7 days).
- `docs/quarterly-plan.md` — Q1–Q4 focus & outcomes.
- `docs/roadmaps/*.csv` — Weekly roadmap and Daily planner CSVs.
- `templates/` — note templates, checklists.
- `.gitignore` — basic Python/Notebook ignores.

> Tip: Commit daily. A short README update is more valuable than perfect code.
